Various indie projects for my own use/amusement
This is the place if you're a potential employer looking to see what I'm capable of!
And yes I do freelance work (mostly 3D printing, scripting, and data)

Bonus: Here's a little game that teaches itself how not to lose (no Python required!)

__FSM_Interface.py__
Drag-n-drop interface for making and running Finite State Machines
Simulation and education tool

__FSM_Module_Template.py__
## IN DEV ##
Module for interacting with FSM_Interface.py through code
Uses include setting up scripted samples and using actual external sensors to run the machines
# Known issue: Closing the window with the red X (instead of .quit()) will leave a daemon process

__FSM_Guide__
Describes usage and intent for FSM_Interface.py
Holds sample files (FSM_save files). Simply drag-n-drop the sample file onto the FSM_Interface window.
